- Welcome! This repo is a boilerplate app architecture for building a static website.
- This application is using `gulp` for task automation and other stuff. Make sure to have it on your local environment. If not, run `npm install gulp -g`, (if permission freaks out, try `sudo npm install gulp -g` as well.)
- Use `nvm` to control the node version. I am using `v8.11.2`.
- How to get started? `npm i` and then `npm run dev`, this is it!
- KNOWN ISSUE: it throws an error when you try to import some vendor css assets served locally.
